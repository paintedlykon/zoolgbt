## **Here's some other awesome resources**

We aren't the only horse in town (so to speak), here's some links to other resources and projects that you might find interesting or helpful. If you think there's something that we're missing, please let us know! 

[Zooier than Thou](https://zoo.wtf/) - A podcast that releases a new episode every full moon. They're more than the average podcast featuring comedy skits, a rotating roster of hosts, and and a new and interesting topic each episode. 

[Bestia Amore](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJv60_sQ1mpYDIgts--KcA) - Another podcast. This one doesn't release on a set schedule but you can expect a new episode every couple months. Featuring free-flowing content and discussions around various important topics to the zoo community.

[Zoo Community](https://zoocommunity.org/) - A small safe for work forum featuring great discussion and community games. If it's your first time engaging with the zoo community directly this is a great place to start with a relaxed atmosphere and nice members.

[ZooVille]() - The largest zoo forum on the internet, there's always something going on there. Boasting over one hundred thousand members and discussion pages in other languages there's something for everyone over there.

[Zeta Verein]() - The home page for a German activist group. Known best for the creation of the ZETA principles, they're a force fighting for the rights of zoosexuals in Europe, and all over the globe.

[Wikipedia]() - Looking for a non-biased quick source of information? The Wikipedia page for Zoosexuality has a lot of really great information on the history of zoos as well as some basic terms. It's a pretty good read!

[Zeta Op Sec]() - The twitter account for Zeta Op Sec, providing information for zoos on how to stay safe while interacting with zoo spaces. Op Sec is short for Operational Security and is used to make sure that your information stays protected.
