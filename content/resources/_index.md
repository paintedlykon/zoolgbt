## **Hello and welcome to zoo.lgbt!** 

We're a PG-13 hub for community articles written by zoosexuals and zoo allies, and an advocacy platform for the advancement of relationships between human and non-human species. The zoo community is growing, and we want to be a reliable source which can provide useful and meaningful information with specific and on-topic articles about a broad range of topics related directly or tangentially to zoosexuality. And to people who are just learning about zoosexuality, or want to know more about what zoos are really like, we can serve as a place to learn more about us, and maybe dispel some of the misconceptions that they might have. 

We also want to serve as a jumping off point for activism efforts when it comes to expanding the zoo message. We want to be able to build up a name and reputation to help direct the voice of the communiy outward to the general public. Because if we want to see real change happen when it comes to society's stance on zoosexuality, we're going to have to find ways to get loud enough to talk on a social level. Whether that's organizing advertising campaigns, promoting zoo media, or doing even more in the future, we want to make sure that we can find and connect zoos and help enable them to help the community at large.

We'll be publishing regularly, so make sure to chcek back often to see the latests of what's going on in the zoo movement!

Have questions, concerns, or ideas for future content? Don't hesitate to reach out! You can find us on (Socials), or send us an message directly at (email). Everything is 100% anonymous, and we won't be storing or using any data we get, so feel free to hit us up!
