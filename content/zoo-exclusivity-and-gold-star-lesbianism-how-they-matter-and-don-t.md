title = "Zoo-Exclusivity and Gold-Star Lesbianism: How They Matter (And Don't) "

In the zoo community, zoo-exclusivity has at times been used divisively, a line separating the zoo-exclusives as "true zoos" from those zoos who are attracted to humans. Zoo-exclusives may feel like non-exclusives were given a "choice" in a way that they weren't, that they don't have to choose between living as a zoo or being alone. And that this choice is part of what defines zoophilia. Non-exclusives may feel that their attractions are a vital aspect of who they are that they can't just reject, regardless of who they might be in a relationship with. That their shared attractions, their experiences or partnerships with animals, and their treatment by society is more important than just one attraction that differs.  
   
 This distinction, and the community tension that results, reminds me of trends that I've seen in lesbian communities. There is a term, "gold star lesbians", which is meant to mean those women who've never slept with a man before. When used seriously, the term implies a sort of superiority, as if realizing one's orientation sooner or being more exclusive is a badge of honor to be worn. As if taking longer to discover your orientation, or having experimented in the past, somehow makes you less of a lesbian in the present.  
   
 There has been a de-emphasis of the distinctions made. If you're lesbian, bi, pan, or something else, as long as you're a wlw (woman who loves women), you belong. But, this can be taken too far as well. There are distinctions between these groups, different issues that they each face, different stereotypes, different experiences. Over-correcting in response to toxic "gold star" attitudes loses the importance of those different experiences along the way.  
   
 We, as zoos, should look to learn from this. At once, we need to take "gold star lesbianism" as a cautionary tale, and not allow exclusion based on who's a "true zoo". But to not take that too far, and to understand that our differences are part of what helps to define us. Zoo-exclusivity, or not, is still a useful tool for understanding ourselves.  
   
 Non-exclusives often have a kinship of experience with having to manage the balance between human partners and animal partners. Sometimes have more trouble coming to terms with their attractions later in life, or as something other than a kink. They may share a sense of not belonging, especially when zoo spaces are more hostile to them.  
   
 Zoo exclusives may have to deal with distaste at common depictions of human intimacy. Perhaps with having to explain why they are "still single at their age". Or with a lack of support in a society that expects, in so many ways, humans to form pairs with each other.  
   
 But, we are all still zoos. While some of our experiences may not be universal, we all do have to face the way society treats us and our animal companions. We do share the most important characteristic of an attraction to and care for animals. We are a community, allies with each other, and subdivisions won't ever be able to change that. That is perhaps the most important lesson to take from the LGBT community - that we are stronger accepting our differences in self-identification, but maintaining that greater sense community regardless. With that in mind, we can understand each other all the better, and to help others understand us as they look into our community.
