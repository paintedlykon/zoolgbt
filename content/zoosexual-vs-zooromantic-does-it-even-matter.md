Over the last couple of years the zoo community has been bustling with the use of new terms and definitions. Among them the term "zooexuality" stands out and, more recently, an incleasing amount of community members also use the term "zooromantic". But what's the difference between these two? Does it really matter? And are they mutually exclusive?


First of all, it's important to highlight that the term "zoosexuality" is often used interchangeably with the more traditional "zoophilia". It is for this reason that many newcomers to the community often ask themselves whether there is a difference between these two terms.

#### Context: zoophilia vs zoosexuality

In order to solve any doubts and be able to delve further into the potential distinction (or lack thereof) between zoosexuality and zooromanticism, let us first provide a short answer to the prominent question of "zoosexuality vs zoophilia": *at zoo.lgbt we believe these two words can be used interchangeably and there should be no practical difference between the two*.

Just like every word, despite being synonym of another, tends to have its own specific meaning and nuance, it's fair to say that by themselves the suffixes -sexuality and -philia might have their own connotations and semantic differences. However, in the context of an attraction to non-human animals, the usage of the term "zoosexuality" follows a conscious goal of highligting this attraction to what it really is: a fully fledge sexual orientation. Thus, while the term "zoophilia" has been used historically to refer to our attraction, the term zoosexuality goes one step beyond and casts light to the true and genuine feeling of so many of us: that our attraction meets the criteria of a genuine sexual orientation.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia#Zoosexuality) defines the origin and meaning behind zoosexuality in the following way:
>The term zoosexual was proposed by Hani Miletski in 2002[4] as a value-neutral term. Usage of zoosexual as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word – as, for instance, in the phrase "zoosexual act" – may indicate sexual activity between a human and an animal. The derivative noun "zoosexuality" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate sexual orientation manifesting as sexual attraction to animals.

In short: they both refer to the same and zoos should be free to describe themselves with either term, altough keeping in mind that the word "zoosexuality" or "zoosexual" might have more bite when it comes to standing up for ourselves and the validity of our attraction as a bona-fide sexual orientation.

Furthermore, it should be noted that same-sex attraction underwent a similar tranformation by the second half of the 20th century, whereas "homophilia" was the preferred term used by its supporters during the 50s and 60s in an attempt to avoid the clinical implications of a sexual pathology. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology_of_homosexuality#Homophile).

In any case, whether zoophilia/zoosexuality or homophilia/homosexuality, it's safe to say that both word endings attempt to describe the same attraction. An attraction which, let's keep in mind, is as complex as human nature itsef and which can only be summarized by a single word at the cost of ignoring any of the very specific idiosyncrasies which are unique to each individual.

#### Zoosexual vs zooromantic: very often mutually inclusive!

Now that we've given a bit more context on the lack of practical differences between zoophilia and zoosexuality, let's have a look at these two terms and how they stand in relation to each other.

At this point we would like to point out that zoo.lgbt doesn't claim authority over the zoosexual community. We're just one more voice, trying to tell our story and share our thoughts in an oceans of opinions where differences and intellectual debate should be welcomed and cherished!

With this disclaimer out of the way, our interpretation is that zooromanticism is just a subset, a specific behavior, feeling or experience of the wide sexual orientation that is zoosexuality.

If we take a look at other more established sexual orientations like homosexuality, it would be fairly rare to find someone who identifies themselves as purely homoromantic but refuses to use the term "homosexual" to reject any form of sexual attraction to humans of their same gender. It is much more common for a person to identify themselves as asexual as well as gay, bi or heterosexual.

Once again, it might help to quote an article from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality#Definition,_identity_and_relationships)
> Many people who identify as asexual also identify with other labels. These other identities include how they define their gender and their romantic orientation. They will oftentimes integrate these characteristics into a greater label that they identify with. Regarding romantic or emotional aspects of sexual orientation or sexual identity, for example, asexuals may identify as heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, or by the following terms to indicate that they associate with the romantic, rather than sexual, aspects of sexual orientation:
    aromantic; lack of romantic attraction towards anyone
    biromantic; by analogy to bisexual
    heteroromantic; by analogy to heterosexual
    homoromantic; by analogy to homosexual
    panromantic; by analogy to pansexual
    
The bottom line here is that we should not associate the word ending "-sexual" with the sexual act itself. **By convention "-sexual" is used nowadays to describe a sexual orientation, an attraction which can be romantic, sexual and/or emotional in nature.** Any of these three attractions can be present in any degree. As long as at least one of these attractions is present and the person itself feels that this attraction is part of their spectrum of sexual orientation, they should be able to identify as zoosexual. Thus:

- A zoosexual can be solely attracted to non-human animals in a sexual manner.
- A zoosexual can be solely attracted to non-human animals in a romantic manner.
- A zoosexual can be solely attracted to non-human animals in an emotional manner. In this case generally, the emotional bond will be so strong that the person in question might feel that terms such as zoosexuality or zoophilia offer a distinct and relevant way to describe themselves.

Any of the above can be present in any degree, combination and possibly even in such a way where it becomes obvious that the human language does not have the appropriate vocabularity to describe the complexity of the human psyche.

#### Sexuality is fluid and cannot be accurately described with simple labels
In the end we would be doing ourselves a disservice if we tried to force people into distinct labels or categories. Words can only be so accurate and useful when it comes to capturing the complexity and often subconscious nature of our own sexuality.

There is a real possibility that a person who identifies as being attracted to animals only in a romantic manner, might find a spark of sexual attraction later in life. Maybe they will only feel sexual attraction ocasionally or even only for certain species and under certain circumstances. But, does it really matter?

Every person is different and it's already darn hard for many people to accept their sexual or romantic attraction to non-human animals, that the last thing we possibly want is to build artificial walls between ourselves which can only cause confusion and self-doubt when a person finds their self-image challenged only because we insisted on applying an arbitrary label to it.

The term "zooromantic" is extremely useful in the context of describing or explaining one's own inclination to feel romantically attracted to non-human animals. But we shouldn't make the (in our opinion) mistake of excluding people who only feel this type of attraction from the wider zoosexual community or believing that zoosexuality / zoophilia is a term that they shouldn't be free to use.

Whether one's attraction is sexual, romantic and/or emotional, we should be able to identify as zoosexuals (or zoophiles) and be aware that our sexuality is fluid, personal to us and that it does not matter in which form of attraction it manifests itself now or at any future point in life. We are all zoos and we should all feel included.

Finally, if a person who is only attracted romantically to non-human animals and want to explicitly describe themselves in such a way for whatever reasons, there are alternatives such as: "non-practicing zoo" or "asexual zoo". The former describes the lack of sexual practice with non-human animals in a neutral non-judgmental way, while the latter describes the lack of sexual attraction and, consequently, implies the lack of sexual practice. In both cases, however, the person can still identify themselves as zoosexual.

In conclusion: zoosexuality and zoophilia both can be used to describe a person's sexual orientation. And, since a sexual orientation describes an extremely complex and fluid variety of feelings, which can range from sexual, romantic and/or emotional attraction in any degree and combination, it's fair to say that zooromanticism is but a subset of zoosexuality: a word used to describe a specific attraction that a zoosexual person might experience.

Does the difference between the two matter? If we consider that most people who feel sexually attracted to their non-human companions often also harbor romantic feelings for them, then not really. The word 'zooromantic' is still useful in certain circumstances, but is still covered by the wider umbrella of zoosexuality.
